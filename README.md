# 7DTD-Toolman Mod
A [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) game mod that adds a new Toolman skill set and
makes construction tools (axes, pickaxes, and shovels) more viable as weapons.

## Description
This mod adds a new skill set in the strength tree called Toolman that is focused on using
the construction tools (axe, pickaxe, shovel, nailgun, chainsaw, auger) as main weapons in
addition to their building / harvesting utility. Perks have been adjusted, where appropriate,
to apply to these tools. The tools have been adjusted to be more effective in combat.

The following changes are currently implemented:

- Axe, pickaxe, and shovel have knockdown effect (based on Toolman progression)
- Axe, pickaxe, and shovel, chainsaw, and auger cause bleeding (based on Toolman progression)
- Big and Fast perk applies to axe, pickaxe, and shovel
- Nailgun damage and magazine size has been adjusted to be a more effective ranged weapon
- Nailgun has been given 4 mod slots. Mods currently supported include:
    - Magazine Extender
    - Drum Magazine
    - Rad Remover
    - Burst-fire
    - Fully automatic fire
    - Folding Stock
    - Cripple-em
- Nails have increased damage
- New recipe for Steel Nails (nailgun AP ammo) has been added
- Penetrator perk applies to Nailgun
- Stamina usage has been reduced on the Impact Driver tool

This mod can be added to or removed from existing saves without any known critical side effects.
