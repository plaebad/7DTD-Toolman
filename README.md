# 7DTD-Toolman Mod
A [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) game mod that adds a new Toolman skill set and
makes construction tools (axes, pickaxes, and shovels) more viable as weapons.

## Description
This mod adds a new skill set in the strength tree called Toolman that is focused on using
the construction tools (axe, pickaxe, shovel, nailgun, chainsaw, auger) as main weapons in

to apply to these tools. The tools have been adjusted to be more effective in combat.
